## Mission Statement

Our mission is to enable talented Techies to have the biggest possible impact on the world and with that create the maximum value for our clients. As a R&D company, we constantly explore and create new tech products from every field to always stay at the cutting edge of technology.  Motius believes that growth can only be achieved by enabling people, providing the necessary infrastructure and share knowledge with each other.

Open source software and hardware is an integral part of your daily business, whether you realize it or not.  It’s in the cloud, in your phone, in your car and in your homes. All of it provided by individuals and organizations that care and want to lend out their expertise to our community free of charge. That's why we want to push the open source community regardless of whether Motius directly benefits from it - we all use OSS code, so we should give back!

## What is this page about?

Working with emerging tech is our day-to-day job. As our team loves and contributes the open source community, we decided to gather their work and give a platform a curation of our work.  

The idea is to promote the open source work of our whole team - ELU projects, client projects but also curated private repositories from our team members. If a team member is active in the open source community, he or she should get credit for it! We are proud of this work and want to share it with you.

## What is ELU?

ELU is our company-wide method for innovation and further education. Every 6 months, we ask our Motees about what new stuff they would like to learn. The only condition is that it should be a technology or approach that isn’t older than a year.
Every second Friday, we block the whole day and tike time to learn those things in teams. Here, the actual application of the technology in a project is not important, it is all about discovering new tech. This lasts for 6 months. Once we're done, we go to mountains and spend a weekend finalizing our products and presenting stuff that we learned to the rest of our team.
Once we come back, we start over.

## Our current repositories

- [django-rest-recaptcha](https://github.com/motius/django-rest-recaptcha): Our star lead so far! _Django rest recaptcha field for easy integration of google recaptcha with django-rest-framework._
- [dockerfiles](https://github.com/motius/dockerfiles): Dockerfiles from our daily work at Motius. Continued work on nextcloud, nginx-php but also bareos, sonarqube, polr, ...
- [react-native-telephony-apis](https://github.com/motius/react-native-telephony-apis): One that should have been on npm a while ago.. we'll get there! _An interface to the CoreTelephony (Cocoa) framework and TelephonyManager (Android) for React Native._
- [nginx-docker-env](https://github.com/motius/nginx-docker-env): _It's a container that packages an nginx server with bindings for running Lua scripts and the Lua DKJSON library. When you have a project where you need to serve some application that needs access to the environment variables of the container then you can use this container to quickly do that._
- ... to be continued!

## Some cool private projects from our team

In their freetime, our people do their own projects and actively take part in the open source community. So we curated some of the work - here it goes (in no particular order because you are all awesome):

- [micropython-IMU](https://github.com/micropython-IMU): A collection of device drivers and modules for attitude determination and navigation.
- [Webexcel](https://github.com/michaelneu/webxcel): one of the crazier ones! _Webxcel creates a full-fledged RESTful web backend from your Microsoft Excel workbooks. It is written in 100% plain Visual Basic macros and comes with a lot of handy tools to help you build the next big thing._
- [test-genie](https://github.com/tech4242/test-genie): group effort from an ELU team. _A small Go server to help you unit test your frontend by fetching "real" mock data from your live server. The whole point is to let you unit test your frontend with up-to-date data instead of static json files in your frontend code._
- [hackatum-windowsIotCamera](https://github.com/Hustenbonbon/hackatum-windowsIotCamera): old but gold from HackaTUM 2016. _Windows IoT background app for raspberry pi. It uses an ultrasonic sensor, a DHT11 for humidity and temperature and a webcam to take pictures_
- [small-data-classification](https://github.com/aprams/small-data-classification): can't go anywhere without TF nowadays, so here is some deep learning. _This project allows binary image classification for small datasets, based on retraining the final layer of a MobileNetV2._
- [tippi-link](https://github.com/furqan-shakoor/tippi-link) together with [sharfoo](https://github.com/furqan-shakoor/sharfoo): Sharfoo is a MacOS menu bar app that tracks the status of your TP-Link router, which uses tippi-link - a scraper for the TP-LINK router admin portal.
